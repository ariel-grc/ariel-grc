# 👋 Hi, I'm Ariel

### 🛡️ Information Security Compliance | GRC & Risk Analyst | Bridging Security, Compliance & Trust  

---

I’m a GRC and InfoSec analyst passionate about building secure, audit-ready, and user-centered systems. With a foundation in emergency management and 3+ years supporting SaaS platforms in HealthTech, EdTech, and emergency response, I bring a practical approach to cybersecurity governance, risk analysis, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance.

I bridge the gap between technical implementation and human risk, with hands-on experience in:

📊 Security monitoring, fraud detection & access risk analysis

📋 Developing NIST SP 800-53 & HIPAA-aligned InfoSec policies

🔄 Supporting third-party risk reviews and client assurance efforts

📢 Designing security awareness training & user enablement content
