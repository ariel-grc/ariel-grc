# 👋 Hi, I'm Ariel

🛡️ Information Security Compliance | GRC & Risk Analyst | Security Control Assessor
🔍 Bridging Security, Compliance & Trust through Human-Centered Cybersecurity

I'm a GRC and InfoSec analyst focused on building secure, audit-ready, and user-centered systems. With a foundation in emergency management and 3+ years supporting SaaS platforms in HealthTech, EdTech, and GovTech, I bring a practical, compliance-aware approach to cybersecurity governance, risk analysis, and regulatory alignment.

I specialize in translating complex security frameworks into actionable strategies that balance control assurance with usability. My hands-on experience includes:

- 📊 Security control assessments, access reviews & risk analysis  
- 📋 Developing NIST SP 800-53 & HIPAA-aligned InfoSec policies  
- 🔄 Supporting third-party risk reviews and audit documentation 
- 📢 Designing security awareness content to promote behavior change and reduce risk
