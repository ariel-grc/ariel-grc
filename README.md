# 👋 Hi, I'm Ariel

🛡️ GRC & Cyber Risk Analyst  
Focused on building risk-based, audit-ready security programs that connect assets, controls, and enterprise risk.

I specialize in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) with hands-on experience supporting SaaS platforms in EdTech, GovTech, and healthcare-adjacent environments. My background in emergency management informs a practical, resilience-focused approach to cybersecurity governance, risk assessment, and regulatory alignment.

I focus on translating complex frameworks into actionable governance artifacts that support audits, executive decision-making, and sustainable security operations.

🔍 Core Focus Areas

- Risk registers, likelihood × impact scoring, and escalation logic

- Control assessments, maturity modeling, and audit readiness

- Asset-based scoping and control-to-risk traceability

- Policy and governance documentation aligned to enterprise GRC practices
