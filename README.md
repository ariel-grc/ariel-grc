# 👋 Hi, I'm Ariel

🛡️ Information Security Compliance | GRC & Risk Analyst  
🔍 Bridging Security, Compliance & Trust through Human-Centered Cybersecurity

I'm a GRC and InfoSec analyst passionate about building secure, audit-ready, and user-centered systems. With a background in emergency management and over 3 years of experience supporting SaaS platforms in HealthTech, EdTech, and emergency response, I bring a practical, people-first approach to cybersecurity governance, risk analysis, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance.

I specialize in translating complex security frameworks into actionable, human-centric strategies. My hands-on experience includes:

- 📊 Security monitoring, fraud detection & access risk analysis  
- 📋 Developing NIST SP 800-53 & HIPAA-aligned InfoSec policies  
- 🔄 Supporting third-party risk reviews & client assurance efforts  
- 📢 Designing security awareness training & user enablement content
